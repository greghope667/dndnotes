# dndnotes

Notes from my current D&D campaign. This repo is probably only relevant to people in the campaign.

Notes are edited using Cherrytree ( https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/ ), you can install that and open the `notes.ctd` file.
If you understand git and want to contribute you can send pull requests, but it's probably easier to just let me know what you want changed.

A read-only view of the notes is available at https://greghope667.github.io/dndnotes/ .
