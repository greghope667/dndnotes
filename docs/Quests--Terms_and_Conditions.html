<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Terms and Conditions</h1><br/>Ches 22, Night<br /><br /><a href="NPCs--The_Duchess.html">The Duchess</a> asked us to kill a man (<a href="NPCs--Therian.html">Therian</a>) who wronged her in Zoscara.<br /><br />She said we&#39;d find him about 2 miles east of Zoscara, in the forest.<br /><br />She claimed:<br />	He was planning to give information about her to <a href="NPCs--Baron_Rickard.html">Baron Rickard</a>.<br />	He had a contract with her, and he broke the conditions.<br />	Therefore he forfits his life.<br /><br />Icarus didn&#39;t want in on the deal, but Bonri, Damiano and I agreed to help.<br /><br />She took a small amount of our blood, claimed that she could use magic to track us throughout the city.<br /><br />Gave us teleportation rings with her symbol - we can use these to teleport back to her lair from certain locations.<br /><br />We set out east to find the man. <br /><br />While on route, <a href="NPCs--Lieutenant_Grey.html">Grey</a> gave us a reply to our message - the <a href="NPCs--Baron_Rickard.html">Baron</a> agreed to meet us immediately.<br /><br />We found an abandoned camp at the described location. Maybe Therian was here, but knew we were coming?<br /><br />Found a <a href="Locations--Cave_in_Zoscara_Woodland.html">blackened area and cave</a> nearby, similar to near <a href="Locations--Near_Blackwater_Lake.html">Blackwater Lake</a>. Using magic, we tracked a group nearby with identical teleportation rings.<br /><br />A halfling, possibly <a href="NPCs--Therian.html">Therian</a>, was heading through the cave.<br /><br />Combat:<br />At the end of the cave was Therian, and a group including a Drow (with a black stone). When the drow saw us, he teleported away.<br /><br />The drow released some red spiders to attack us. It didn&#39;t go well for us.<br /><br />Therian died.</div>
