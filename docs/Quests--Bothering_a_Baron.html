<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Bothering a Baron</h1><br/>Ches 23, Late afternoon<br /><br />We went to meet the <a href="NPCs--Baron_Rickard.html">Baron</a> (following his invitation) in his castle to discuss the magical items we brought into the city.<br /><br />He told us <a href="NPCs--Nathaniel.html">Nathaniel</a> was killed by the guards.<br /><br />We were to a party/reception hosed by the Baron on Ches 25.<br /><br />He claimed the ban on magic was due to multiple ‘goings on’ - not a single concrete event.<br /><br />Bonri ‘aquired’ some notes written in a strange cypher on the Baron&#39;s desk.<br /><br />Icarus ‘aquired’ some letters of corresponance off the Baron&#39;s desk.<br /><br />I&#39;m in a party of criminals here...<br /><br />The note was from someone calling themselves ‘Trianna’. The Baron was apparently aquiring a weapon from her in a couple of days.<br /><br />We went back to the Temple of Tier to meet the enchanter who offered to remove the <a href="Items--Illaras_Amulet.html">amulet</a> from Bonri.<br />Since the Duchess already removed the neckless, we had to ‘withold the truth’ a bit.<br /><br />In the evening, we went down to The Well to do some drinking/bonding.</div>
