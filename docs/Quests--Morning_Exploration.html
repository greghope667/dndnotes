<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Morning Exploration</h1><br/>Ches 22, (Early) Morning<br /><br />Bonri and I decided to explore Zoscara together and investigate the <a href="Items--Illaras_Amulet.html">necklace</a>.<br /><br />The necklace seemed to drain more life from Bonri overnight.<br /><br />We went to the archive in Zoscara. They refused to let us in without a permit.<br /><br />We sold our loot from the <a href="Locations--Near_Blackwater_Lake.html">cave</a> from some gold.<br />The jeweller mentioned Lady Tenika Greytales had had some earings stolen, we could investigate.<br /><br />Someone gave us a note secretly - “She will meet you, tonight, sunset, the well”</div>
