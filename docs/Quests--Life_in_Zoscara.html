<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Life in Zoscara</h1><br/>Ches 22, Morning<br /><br />We talked to <a href="NPCs--Narissia.html">Narissia</a> about identifying the <a href="Items--Illaras_Amulet.html">amulet</a>, she told us no magic in the temple or city.<br />Suggested we might be able to identify items outside city.<br /><br />The temple could identify, but not before tomorrow (Ches 23).<br /><br />King&#39;s guard and <a href="NPCs--Lieutenant_Grey.html">Lt.

(We didn&#39;t tell her about the amulet).<br /><br /><br />We bought a 100gp pearl at the ‘Pick and Roll’ jewellers to cast identify, using gold loaned to us (for a day) from the temple of Tier.<br /><br />We sent a letter requesting a meeting with the <a href="NPCs--Baron_Rickard.html">Baron</a> (RE Magic items).<br /><br />Bought some (overly fancy) clothes for Bonri.<br /><br />We sold our horses to pay back the loan from Narissia.<br /><br /><br />Chess 22, Sunset<br /><br />We headed to the tavern called ‘The Well’, following up on the note we received <a href="Quests--Morning_Exploration.html">earlier</a>.<br /><br />Saw suspicious elf/dwarf/halfling in bar.
