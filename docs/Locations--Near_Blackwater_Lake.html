<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Near Blackwater Lake</h1><br/>An area of forest with dead trees (from some nacromacy magic).<br /><br />There&#39;s an underground cave.<br /><br />We found an altar and ritual dagger, and signs of necromantic magic.<br /><br />We found Undead <a href="NPCs--Illara.html">Illara</a> outside, under a fallen tree.<br /><br />There was a silver ring from Trand.<br /><br />Found some stones in the cave, picked one up and got attacked by some ghost-like creature.<br /><br />Found a box with a carving of a spider and pearl.<br /><br />Note in box: “We couldn&#39;t supply the item you wanted, ask the Duchess, tell her ‘The eyes of fate see all’.”</div>
