<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Illara</h1><br/>Commoner in <a href="Locations--Arinsguard.html">Arinsguard</a>. Young half-elf woman. Flowy dark hair. Actually spelled Elara.<br /><br />We found Illara&#39;s body in <a href="NPCs--Nathaniel.html">Nathaniel</a>&#39;s shop?<br /><br />Following Nathaniel&#39;s <a href="Quests--A_Captive's_Request.html">directions</a>, we found her trapped under a tree in the woods? As an undead?<br />We freed her and she attacked us.<br /><br />Had some sort of beauty amulet to hide her being undead?<br /><br />Amulet has some memories or essence of Illara. She thinks it is Ches 4th (15 days ago), no memory since then.<br /><br />Hypothesis: The amulet contains Illara&#39;s essence, projecting it onto the undead body.<br /><br />In the <a href="Locations--Near_Blackwater_Lake.html">cave</a>, she recognised a silver ring from Trand.<br /><br />After removing the amulet from her for some time, she stopped being undead.<br /><br />We buried her (in a shallow grave) in the woods.</div>
